Dennis Universe there is one great energy and we have no name for it people have tried various names for it like God like Brockman like Dao but in the west the word God has got so many funny associations but according to Buddhist philosophy all this universe is one Tata that means 10,000 functions or 10,000 Things One suchness and we're all one substance and therefore it consists of now you see it now you don't hear you are here you are here you want because that's the very nature of energy to be like waves and waves have crests and Trucks Only We are being under a certain kind of sleepiness or Illusion imagine that the trough turn on the light principal and that off is finally going to triumph over on and we shall I say bug ourselves by indulging in that illusion she supposing Darkness did went out wouldn't that be terrible and therefore it is arranged that you stopped being you after a while and then come back to someone else all together and so when you find that out you become full of energy and delight and you suddenly struggles that naturally go with human existence thought to have no hang up that is to say to be able to drift like a cloud and flow like water seeing that all life is a magnificent illusion fundamental you will be afraid on the surface you will be afraid of putting your hand in the fire will be afraid of getting sick but you will not be afraid of fear fear
