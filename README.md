🎙️ YouTube Transcript Search Tool
📌 Overview

Ever wanted to share a specific part of a video but can’t remember the timestamp?
Ever skimmed through a long lecture and wished you could jump straight to the relevant part?
This repository is dedicated to building a tool that helps locate timestamps in videos based on specific spoken words.

This repository provides a Python-based tool that helps locate timestamps in YouTube videos based on spoken words.

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ Downloads the video audio from YouTube.
2️⃣ Converts speech to text using Google’s Speech Recognition.
3️⃣ Outputs a transcript where each word is linked to its timestamp.
4️⃣ Allows searching via CTRL + F (or CMD + F on Mac) to find specific words instantly.

✅ Supports automatic hyperlinking so you can jump directly to the part of the video where a word was spoken.

📂 Project Versions
Older Version (📂 olderVersion/)
Uses pytube for downloading videos.
Originally worked but was blocked by YouTube (403 Forbidden errors).
Latest Version (📂 latestVersion/)
Switches to yt-dlp, a more reliable and actively maintained alternative.
Includes a rudimentary UI built with Flask.
Provides a real-time countdown for estimated processing time.
Ensures hyperlinks are clickable for instant timestamp navigation.

📥 Installation Guide
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
📌 Make sure ffmpeg is installed, as it’s required for audio processing.
On Mac/Linux
brew install ffmpeg
On Windows (via Chocolatey):

choco install ffmpeg
🚀 Running the Application
1️⃣ Start the Flask Server
python app.py
✅ This will launch Flask and automatically open a browser window.

2️⃣ Enter a YouTube URL
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Enter a YouTube video link.
Click "CTRL/CMD HEAR IT IS" to start processing.
3️⃣ Wait for Processing
A countdown timer will show estimated completion time.
Once ready, click "View Output" to see transcript hyperlinks.
4️⃣ Quit the Application
Click "Quit" to stop the server & close the browser tab.

⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations
❌ Processing Time Estimates May Vary

Video length, system performance, and internet speed affect processing time.
❌ Speech Recognition Accuracy Depends on YouTube Captions

The tool relies on Google’s speech recognition API, which may misinterpret words.
❌ YouTube Video Restrictions

Some videos do not allow downloading or transcription via yt-dlp.
❌ Timestamp Resolution Limitations

Since speech is faster than timestamp resolution, multiple words may share the same timestamp.
🔮 Future Improvements
🔹 More accurate word-to-timestamp mapping
🔹 Support for multiple languages
🔹 Better UI with word search & filtering
🔹 Integration with more video platforms (Vimeo, Netflix, etc.)
