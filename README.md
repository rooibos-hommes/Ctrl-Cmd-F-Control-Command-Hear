# Ctrl-Cmd-F-Control-Command-Hear
README (Revised Version 20250203)

Ever wanted to share a specific part of a video but can’t remember the timestamp?
Ever skimmed through a long lecture and wished you could jump straight to the relevant part?
This repository is dedicated to building a tool that helps locate timestamps in videos based on specific spoken words.

How It Works
This first version of the tool is written in Python. Given a YouTube URL, it:

Downloads the video and extracts the audio.
Converts the speech to text.
Outputs a text file with words linked to their closest timestamps.
Allows you to use Ctrl/Cmd + F to search for specific words in the transcript and quickly find their associated timestamps.
Limitations & Future Improvements
Since speech is much faster than the resolution of the timestamps (multiple words can be spoken per second),
multiple words may share the same timestamp.

Accuracy depends on the quality of YouTube’s automatic captions and speech recognition.
Future versions could improve timestamp precision, search capabilities, UI, and integration of other video hosts (Vimeo, Nebula, Netflix, etc).

Contributions Welcome!
This project is still in its early stages, and I’d love for it to be improved over time.
